LArray
=== 
A library for managing large arrays that can hold more than 2G (2^31) entries in Java and Scala.

## Features 
 * 2^31 (2G) is the limitation of the default Java/Scala array size, because 32-bit signed integer (int) is used for the array indexes. To resolve this, LArray uses long type indexes of 64-bit signed integers.
   * For example the entire human genome data (3GB) can be stored in LArray. 
 * LArray can be released from the main memory at any time. 
   * The default arrays in Java/Scala are resident in JVM heaps but the users have no control of the allocated space even if these arrays become unnecessary. That means it is hard to avoid OutOfMemoryException when working with large amount of data.
   * Call LArray.free to release acquired memory resources immediately.
   * Even if you forget to call LArray.free, the acquired memory will be released when GC sweeps LArray instances.
 * LArray is free from the limitation of JVM memory manager.
   * LArray uses memory space outside of the default JVM heap, so creating LArrays with more than -Xmx(maximum memory size) is possible. This is useful when you need large amount of memory or its size is unknown.

## Limitations

  * Only LArray[A] of primitive types can be released from the memory when LArray[A].free is called.
    * LArray[A] of generic objects need to be collected by GC, since objects stored in LArray[A] are on JVM heaps.

## Supported Platforms

LArray uses OS-specific implementation for copying memory contents between LArray and Java arrays. Currently, the following CPU architecutres are supported:

 * Windows (32/64-bit)
 * Linux (amd64 (Intel 64-bit), arm, armhf)
 * Mac OSX (Intel 64bit)

In addition, Oracle JVM (standard JVM) must be used since LArray depends on `sun.misc.Unsafe` class.

## Usage (Scala)
Add the following sbt dependencies to your project settings:

```scala
# In preparation 
libraryDependencies += "org.xerial" % "larray" % "0.1"
```

 * For using snapshot versions:

```scala
resolvers += "Sonatype shapshot repo" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"

libraryDependencies += "org.xerial" % "larray" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
```

You can use LArray in the same manner with the standard Scala Arrays: 

```scala
import xerial.larray.LArray

val l = LArray(1, 2, 3)
val e = l(0) // 1
println(l.mkString(", ")) // 1, 2, 3
l(1) = 5
println(l.mkString(", ")) // 1, 5, 3
    
val l2 = LArray.ofDim[Int](10000L)

// Release the memory resource
l2.free 

l2(0) // The result of accessing released LArray is undefined
```

## Usage (Java)

In Java we cannot provide concise syntaxes as in Scala. Instead, use `apply` and `update` methods to read/write values in arrays.

```java
import xerial.larray.japi.LArray;
import xerial.larray.LIntArray;

LIntArray l = LArray.newLIntArray(10000L);
l.update(0L, 20) // Set l[0L] = 20
l.apply(0L)  //  Get l[0L]

// release 
l.free 
```
